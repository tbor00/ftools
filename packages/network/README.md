# @ftools-suit/network

Network is library of Http Request functions.

This library is based on two very powerful apis which are fetch and axios.
If you need a super lightweight and super powerful module for making requests, you can use our `connection` api (based on fetch)
If you need a super powerful api with all the features of axios you can use our `HttpClient` api (based on axios)


# **Installation**

Using npm
```bash
npm install @ftools-suit/network
```

Using yarn
```bash
yarn add @ftools-suit/network
```

## How to imports?

```js
import { connection, HttpClient } from '@ftools-suit/network'

// or
const { connection, HttpClient } = require('@ftools-suit/network')
```

<br/>

if your goal is to use only connection
```js
import { connection } from '@ftools-suit/network/fetch'
```

<br/>

if your goal is to use only HttpClient
```js
import HttpClient from '@ftools-suit/network/axios'
```

# **How to use?**

## Connection API REFERENCE
<p>This api is intended for simplified and abbreviated use so that you can speed up development time with a tool based on the native fetch api </p>

ðŸš€ **Features**:

- Super lightweight and extensible
- The connection api is based on fetch, so there are some settings that are the same.

You can extract the methods you only want to use or you can use the connection object and access all the methods it has from the object. For example:

```js
import { get, post, put, patch, deleteReq } from '@ftools-suit/network/fetch'

// or

import { connection } from '@ftools-suit/network/fetch'

connection.get()
connection.post()
connection.put()
connection.patch()
connection.delete()
```

### GET METHOD

a basic request is really simple to set up. Have a look at the following:

```js
connection.get('http://example.com/movies.json')
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => setData(data))
```

you can also write something like this:

```js
async function getMovies(){
    try{
        const fetchMovies = await connection.get('http://example.com/movies.json')
        const data = await fetchMovies.json()
        return data
    }catch(err){
        return err
    }
}
```

The first argument is the url we want to connect to, for example:
```js
const url  = 'http://example.com/movies.json' // url of the request
connection.get(url)
```


The second argument is a object of options, which could look something like this: 

```js
async function getMovies(){
    const options = {
        headers: {
            Authorization: 'Bearer ****',
            timestamp: '****'
        }
    }

    return connection.get('http://example.com/movies.json', options).then((res) => res.json())
}
```

These are all that the second options argument accepts

```json
{
    "params": {},
    "headers": {},
    "withCredentials": {},
    "responseType": {},
    "signal": {}, // AbortController().signal
}
```
